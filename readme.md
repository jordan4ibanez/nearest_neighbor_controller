# What is this?

This is a basic test utilizing 2D nearest neighbor button switching when you press a directional button on a controller OR keyboard.

This was created for not only my own sake of learning but for anyone to utilize in their project as a reference.

# Requirements

1. Love2D 11.4 (make a pr if this needs a version update so I can test it)
2. An Xbox One controller OR a keyboard with directional arrows

This is tested only on Xbox One controllers OR keyboard. If you find it works correctly with any other controller, feel free to tell me.
