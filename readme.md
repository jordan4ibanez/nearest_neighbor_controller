# What is this?

This is a basic test utilizing 2D nearest neighbor button switching when you press a directional button on a controller.

This was created for not only my own sake of learning but for anyone to utilize in their project as a reference.

# Requirements

1. Love2D
2. An Xbox One controller

This is tested only on Xbox One controllers. If you find it works correctly with any other controller, feel free to tell me.
